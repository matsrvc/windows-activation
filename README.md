Generic Windows 11 Product Keys | How to Retrieve Windows 11 Product keys
July 8, 2022 by Anoop C Nair

Microsoft provides Generic Windows 11 Product Keys to test the Windows versions. Let’s learn and discuss the list of Windows 11 product keys in this post. Let’s discuss Generic product keys such as VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T.

The generic product keys, such as VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T for Windows 11 pro, are not activation license keys. Those generic Keys can only help you complete the Windows 11 Pro installation process. But not to activate Windows 11.

I also share the different methods to find the Windows 11 product keys from an existing device. This is useful if you forget the Windows 11 product key that is used. Normally if you have a valid Windows 10 product key, that should work for Windows 11 as well. The following are the three easiest methods to retrieve the product keys.

    Registry – GUI and Command-Line.
    WMI – Command-Line and WMI Explorer.
    PowerShell command.

Windows 11 activation is the next step after entering the product key during the installation using USB bootable media. You must activate Windows 11 to use it permanently and enable some features in Windows 11. But for testing Windows 11 just for 5-10 days, activation is not required.

Windows 11 used warnings (as shown in the below screenshot) for unactivated versions of Windows. There are restrictions to enable some features such as dark mode, personalization settings, and themes from being modified until a system is activated.
What are Generic Windows 11 Product Keys

Microsoft provides generic Windows 11 product keys to customers, and it’s available for free. The generic product key’s purpose is to quickly support customers in testing different versions of Windows Operating Systems.

The Generic Product keys are available for Windows Server 2022 and all the other supported server operating systems as well. The testing is the only scenario supported by the rise of Generic Windows Product Keys.

So what is the catch here? The Windows 11 generic Keys can only help you to complete the Windows 11 Pro/ Enterprise installation process but not activate the OS version. To activate Windows 11, you need a valid production license key.
